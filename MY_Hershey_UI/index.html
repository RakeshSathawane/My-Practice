            </h2>

            <div>Snacking habits have changed. Instead of eating the traditional three meals a day, we’re snacking more throughout the day with different expectations depending on when and why we’re snacking. Sometimes it’s for a fun or indulgent treat and other times, it’s for a more functional purpose, like bridging to the next meal. That’s why we offer a broad portfolio of snacking choices to meet a variety of snacking needs, from more indulgent treats and smaller portions to better-for-you snacks.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            <div>The breadth of our portfolio continues to grow as we bring an exciting array of new products to shelves, such as zero sugar and reduced-sugar chocolates and snacks made with sweeteners such as fruit juices.&nbsp; We are creating new snacks that will explore the latest in wholesome and better-for-you ingredients with more protein, colors from natural sources, new sugars and no GMOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</div>

            <div>We are always seeking more ways to make moments with more people. Whether it’s our beloved&nbsp;Reese’s&nbsp;Peanut Butter cups and their thinner version or our popped perfection&nbsp;SkinnyPop&nbsp;Popcorn, you can choose the moments to enjoy our delicious brands in ways that are right for you.&nbsp;<br><br></div>

            <div>We make snacking easy.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;your choice.</div>
